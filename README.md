 # CalorieCounter
 This simple MATLAB script allows the user to track calories they intake and burn throughout the day and see this data over time.
 ## Description
This code has two main functions: a food calorie tracker and an exercise calorie tracker. The food calorie tracker allows the user to input the amount of calories they consume at each meal, while the exercise calorie tracker allows the user to choose an exercise and calculate the calories they burned from it by entering the time they spent exercising and their weight. The script will then plot graphs of the user's net caloric activity for that day, as well as over a recent time period. 
## Installation/Execution
To run this script, simply download the CalorieCounter.m file and open it in a MATLAB installation on your machine. Run the script and start tracking immediately!
